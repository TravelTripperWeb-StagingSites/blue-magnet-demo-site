The Rapids river is the MOST fun. Grab a vest and float on through. We do it at least 4-6 times every time we go. It's an absolute blast! There are fast slides and slower slides for all levels of bravery. There are also 2 wave pools which is great so that its not so crowded. The food is very good at any watery you go to. People walk around and take pictures of you and your family for you to view and buy in the photo gallery which is great for memories since most people aren't carrying their phones around. All in all it's a great waterpark.",

The food my granddaughter wanted wasn't included in the plan, so we had to spend more on food.  Would have been better to pay as we went.  Wish I had gotten a bracelet to charge to my card.  We had to go back and forth to the lockers to get money every time we wanted to make a purchase.",
