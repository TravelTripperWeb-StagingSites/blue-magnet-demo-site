Across all the Disney parks there is something for everyone to enjoy, and the firework displays at the end of the evening are brilliant.

          "text": "Disney can be loads of fun, but requires planning and a strategy to get value for your money. I really don't like that you must now purchase tickets for the exact date (s) of your visit. Best way to do Disney is with annual pass combined with their phone app to set up fast passes. You pretty much need to pick your 3 fast passes that are allowed for the day 30 days in advance. Understand that people who reserve their room at a Disney property get many more advantages. If they buy tickets with their reservation, they can set up fast passes 60 days in advance. Those with disabilities will need to register with each park's guest services to be allowed \"return time\". All party members must go with that person to be included in the party. That means the disabled party goes to the gate keeper of an attraction's ride, they are issued a time to return and join the fast pass line. Only one return time may issed at a time. There is limit to size of party. Disabled person must badge through 1st in fast pass line.",

We had stayed at a Disney resorts ( Pop Century) last time and we were satisfied with the accommodation. The price for me was appropriate it included the  3 park tickets for 3 people. The room in their website   looks bigger than the actual room itself but true to the amenities as  listed. Comfortable bed and pillows makes a good night  sleep a welcome after a tiring day of walking at the park is well worth it. Expect that everything in Disney is a bit over priced especially if you drink bottled water. If your in for convenience having the meal plan might be the way to go for you and your family with several choices when you get to the parks itself but it might be pricey. If you’re in a budget then paying your meal as you go depends on your $ choice. The resort staff are friendly and approachable. Over all our stay was pleasant. And would  recommend it. They usually have great deals for a family of four!",
