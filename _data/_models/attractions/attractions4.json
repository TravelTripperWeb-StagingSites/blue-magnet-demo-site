          "text": "Disney is the epitome of what a theme park should be.  The grounds are extremely well kept considering the volume of people and the staff are wildly helpful.  If you stop for a moment looking confused one of the staff from an actor to a grounds keeper will stop to give directions.  The park not only has rides but mini shows such as storm troopers from Star Wars patrolling the streets or army men from Toy Story marching past.  Even the staff in theme areas do not break character so prepare your movie knowledge to have fun conversations.  The rides are amazing for kids and still very enjoyably for adults.  The best advice I can give is to understand how to schedule your fast passes well.  We rode nearly ever ride and some twice in a single day, but be ready to walk a lot.  When I say a lot I mean 20,000 or more steps.  All in all, this is a 'magical' place where movies do come to life.",

Got vast parking spaces and shuttles frequently picks you and drops you to and fro the parking area. All the eatables are heavily priced inside the park. Outside food is allowed, so it's better to take some food. Do a research on fast passes. I took it for Indiana Jones, but it was unnecessary as it had vast space. The shows are very good.

Despite missing our friends and family, we greatly miss the magic of Disney. We had an opportunity to come \"home\" this week and spent some time at Hollywood Studios - our favorite Disney park. In addition to the parks always being in pristine condition, the Cast Members always go out of their way to make sure we have the best time - whether we're Florida residents or not! Huge shout out to Robert on the tram, he made sure the Disney magic continued from our way out of the park to our car. \"Ain't no party like a Disney party, Hollywood STUDIOS!\" Thank you Disney, Robert, and all of the Cast Members for a magical day! We'll see ya real soon!",
