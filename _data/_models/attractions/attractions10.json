I had purchased tickets for an event that were non refundable. I called universal and explained the situation. I asked if there was anything that could be done about the non - refundable tickets. They refunded me! They did not have to. The non-refund policy was clearly stated on the tickets I purchased. Way to go for a big company to have compassion of an individual going through a difficult time! A company with a heart!  So grateful. Can’t wait to go back in December!",

The lines are so big during the weekend and holidays it’s recommended to get express passes or plan your vacation in low season which is much better to enjoy all the attractions and have a better experience. Regular parking costs 26 dollars and VIP parking 40 dollars if you want save money just take the regular parking which will be fine anyways. My whole family loved the Harry Potter Experience and Rides. It’s just the best!!!!",
