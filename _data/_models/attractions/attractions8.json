They are very attentive and make sure your day is everything you want it to be.  You first get fitted for a wet suit which will accommodate ANYONE no matter your size.  Then you have breakfast which is very good food and lots of variety.  There is a bird atrium that allows you to feed exotic birds, they will land on you and eat out if your hand.  Swimming with the dolphins is the BEST experience and well worth the extra cost it's a MUST!!!  Swimming with stingrays and exotic fish, sharks and otters.  Then you can do your own swimming in a cove and also lazy river.  The water is so nice and warm and refreshing.  It's a perfect day to relax get some sun and have some fun!!  I will definitely be back.  Breakfast, dinner, dinner and snacks are available all day and included.",

They had space heaters all around the park to keep the air warm enough. The water was astonishingly warm. Plus they provided full coverage wetsuits. Because it was January, the park wasn't very full. It felt very exclusive. The buffet was tasty, they had lots of options even things my picky eater could enjoy. It made the day so easy and comfortable. The best part was the snorkeling on the \"reef\". Truly a breathtaking experience. My daughter said it was the best birthday ever! We would love to do it again.",
