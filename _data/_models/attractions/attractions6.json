And the environment is just amazing. I don’t feel like the food is generally good quality at Disney, and is super over priced, but this was one of the better experiences. \n\nDisney is of course, amazing. They bring the magic, and their entertainment, decoration detail, and service is amazing. I’m not a huge fan of the price, especially to park hop, since most of the parks have just a few great rides, and to get the real experience, you kind of need to park hop (unless you got 4 days). Also, if you’re comparing to Disneyland, the transportation is a lot more stressful at Disney World (especially with kids), and at the end of the day, it’s a mad house. Overall, an enjoyable time! Even with long wait times.",

The Mrs and I have annual passes so we go with our boy or friends all the time, especially during food and wine, festival of the arts, and the flower and garden show. I basically go for the food because the portions of alcohol are a little small for the price, but to each own, really. The rides and features of the park are currently being updated, and definitely needed it here and there, so bare with Disney for the time being. Just go and enjoy what Epcot has to offer you!",
