Coming here during peak summer season, I noticed the place was actually not terribly packed. Lines took within 15 minutes, and snack locations are decent for a standard Disney property. The main attraction is their wave pool, which is North America's largest. You can easily body surf and ride on the waves that are pushed out! I would recommend this place, regardless of whether or not you've ever been to a water park - you'll definitely have a blast!\n\nIf this review was helpful, please consider a thumbs up. It would be greatly appreciated!",

We spent most of our time at the wave pool which had waves going at full blast the whole night! The lazy river had fun floats, and we really enjoyed the music they had playing. The other thing we really loved was that there were no lines or very short lines for all of the slides. That was awesome! Great night, highly recommend!",

Bowled me off my feet literally, safest place is further in as you Bob up and down as opposed to being knocked over. For smaller children the shallows can be dangerous as the wave is so big it pushes them back and the floor isn't smooth leading to scraped knees and elbows. Would take them out to where you can stand and keep a tight hold on them as the wave comes by.",

However, I had a wonderful day at the park with my son.  We had lots of fun on the lazy river, the titular Typhoon Lagoon wave pool, and several excellent water slides.  If you get lunch, I would skip the burgers, mine was pretty dry, chicken fingers would probably have been a better choice.  If you're into soft served ice cream, get some, it was delicious.  It's pricey, but parking is free, so there's that.  I'll definitely be back.",
