However, after entering the park my mood was instantly improved. \n\nPlenty of eating and drinking options, and I was impressed with the quality of the food. \n\nThe roller coasters were awesome; it was nice to have a little thrill in between exhibits/shows. I was impressed by the look and feel of the queue lines. Other parks with roller coasters don’t spend too much time/money on queues but SeaWorld has taken that into consideration. \n\nThere is plenty of walking, look to probably get around 5 miles in. \n\nThe Killer Whale show was awesome. They are really spectacular. My family was impressed by the size of the animals and the cool looks you can get whether standing on tanks, standing underneath tanks, or just the general views.",

          "text": "Update Sept. 2019: To pay for parking is one of the worst parts. It is not as smooth or efficient as other parks. It takes so long. You see people walking around, some smoking a cigarette. It takes way too long and then to merge into one lane shortly after is a very poorly thought out design. \n\nThe penguin ride is a neat concept and cute, however it is WAY TOO SHORT. I am hoping SeaWorld doesn't turn into Busch gardens were the only rides they have are coasters and rides for 5 years old. They need better family rides for those who aren't into coasters. Infinity falls is a decent addition, but not everyone wants to get wet. Disney is breaking ground with those type of rides. Please no more coasters. \n\nIf you can get SeaWorld at a good price it's well worth it, however, I'd avoid weekends and as stated previously, some areas really do show their age.\n__________________\nLots of things to do. Some of the areas are dated: parking lot, theaters,ride queues. Paying for parking is really slow. Not necessarily sea world's fault when we went as car in front of us took forever to get cash and after second time the attendant asked for the fee, the man gave her the wrong amount, but would be nicer if it went quicker overall.\n\nLove the thrill rides and the animals. A lot of cool learning experiences. Will be going back.",
