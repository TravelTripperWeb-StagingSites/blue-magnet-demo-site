Case in point- train your staff better.",

It's hard to believe this is their renovation from a few years ago after Camping World RV company became their sponsor and changed the venerable Citrus Bowl to it's current name and incarnation. However, the Levy Foods heralded and maintained food/concession venues are excellent, clean, diverse and well run. Other than the high roller locales throughout the upper part and in select locales throughout the stadium which are always generously supplied with excellent stadium fare, you can get almost anything at the regular concessions from pizza to Southern barbeque items, decent drinks and beer/wine at various bars throughout, and some fun souvenirs based on the venue you're attending from football to concerts. Just wish they had thought of a better, more efficient ventilation system.",
