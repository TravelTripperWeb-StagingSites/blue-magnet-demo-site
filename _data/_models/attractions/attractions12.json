And, what an honor and privilege it was to be there, participate and place in an international tournament! We'd go back in a heartbeat. So, why only 4 stars? The answer is because it's just so outrageously expensive that I can't, in good conscience, give it 5 stars. From the parking (don't go the paid route) to the entry fee (players are usually free, but the rest of the family will hurt your pocketbook) to the price of food and drinks inside (at least that was expected, but wow) just be prepared for several hundred dollars in additional costs that you probably didn't fully expect but must be budgeted for eventually.",
