Definitely get one of the dole pineapple ice cream drinks (which there is an adult version) - if you haven't had it you're missing a treat.",

The scenery is beautiful and there's trees everywhere, its simply a beautiful place to walk through. The train ride to the petting zoo area was by far our favorite attraction there. There's lots to do and of course plenty of animals! ALTHOUGH, to see some of the more exotic larger animals you need to go on the safari ride, and the wait time was almost 2hrs for most of the day (time we were not willing to stand in line unfortunately) But despite the regular downsides to any crowded Disney park, I would recommend checking this one out.",
