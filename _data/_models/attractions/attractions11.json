The crowds were small and quiet today and there's lot to see here, my favorite part is the area with iconic landmarks built with nothing but LEGO bricks, you'll be stunned and must see this area. Of course, the water park was great, too. The pool water was warm, which wasn't very helpful since the weather was warm as well, but at least in the kids area the water was cooler. The wave pool was a cool experience as well and it's a nice touch that there's LEGO bricks in the pool for you to stack together and build something, but there was also building outside the pool on the sand. I'd say I enjoyed this park more than I've enjoyed amusement parks in a long while. This was a great treat, and I hope to be back sometime.",

We got a fantastic deal for a Beach Retreat stay that included an amazing breakfast buffet, two nights and park tickets. The crowds were a breath of fresh air compared to Disney and the rides were actually a lot of fun and worth the time. The water show was great and really impressed us. Make sure to take time to soak up the grounds. The gardens are perfectly kept and the LEGO city’s and displays are something you’ll only see at the park. I had heard about Granny’s Apple fries before and they were just as good as billed. I might have stopped for them three times!",

Plus, a little surprise for little ones! In your room, there will be a treasure chest hunt in which there will be a box with a lock on it that looks like a safe. I bet you that your kids will have hours of fun with the free legos inside! You are also provide enough beds to support family of 7! This includes a child bunk bed, along with another bed to be folded out on the bottom, a queen size bed for a couple, including space fro a younger child, and a chair that transforms into ANOTHER bed! This also includes an early entrance if having a  ticket purchase to Lego Land Theme park. I'm not even sure if I described all the amazing features! One more thing is budget. This hotel is at an very cheap one to afford, yet an amazing one. However, i did have a little disappointment that the room was pretty much a plain room with Lego wallpaper. But, to boost it up, they have brick built Lego models all over the room! In fact, you should go there to see how amazing it is for yourself.",
