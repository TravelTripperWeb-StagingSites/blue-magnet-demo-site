The wave pool was good as well as the seating, though finding seating wasn't very easy and I wish the chairs that lay almost all the way down were adjustable to set the seat back up. The lazy river was really nice, especially with the cold water coming from some of the places you pass under on a hot day. I didn't get a chance to do any of the slides or tube rides but they looked like they would be fun. The Tike's Peak area for smaller children is nice because it has smaller slides and a tube ride they can go on. I didn't get to see the Ski Patrol Training area but my kids kids loved it. Apparently that area is not for \"tweens\" so kids who are 13 or older might not be able to do everything there. The only problem is that the Florida summer weather cut our day short by a few hours. I would definitely expect this to be a possibility if you're visiting in summer. There's rain daily and a lot of time it's with an electric storm which they have to clear almost all of the park for. The ski lift was actually shut down well before anything else just because there was a thunderstorm reported somewhere in the area. Everything else ran until a while later when the storm was actually close enough to hear and lightning was seen.",
