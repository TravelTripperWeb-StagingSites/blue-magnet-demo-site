It's a nice enough stadium, with enough of the amenities and facilities if expect at a sporting venue like this. I really enjoyed having the Ruckus drum line there, they really add to the atmosphere. If only the team could improve and our fan base improve I think we could have one heck of a soccer atmosphere for a major league sport. The general design of the stadium allows for a great place to watch a match, especially when it's not too hot here in Orlando.\n\nFood prices were high as expected, but not quite as bad as other places I've been to. If you are a season ticket holder or a member of the special club Lion Nation (about $60 per year) you get a discount on the food.",
