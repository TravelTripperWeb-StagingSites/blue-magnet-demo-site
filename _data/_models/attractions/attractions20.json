I had the pleasure of travelling to Orlando, FL for my birthday vacation and I almost didn't return home! I was able to sight see a little bit and one of the places I made a personal goal to stop by was at the Florida Mall. This came highly recommended by my family who are residents of the area and my only regret was that I wished I spent much more time venturing around the mall. I didn't get far because there were already stores that caught my eye at the entrance. Talk about a kid in a candy store!\n\nIt's conveniently located on \"the OBT strip,\" or on Orange Blossom Trail. Those that are familiar with this area may already know, but I was thrilled to discover how close it was close to Disney World, Universal Studios, the Fun Spot, etc. There's both indoors and outdoors dining, also. They do an excellent job with the landscaping and cleanliness and it's definitely an ideal spot for all ages. I'll definitely be returning whenever I'm in the Orlando, FL area!",
